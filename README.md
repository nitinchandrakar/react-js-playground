# Setup react project:
npx create-react-app my-app

# note
If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

# Folder structure 
    package.json - all dependcy are define here
    src - all the source file here
    public - Only one single html file

    src/index.js - entry point of every react app
    ReactDOM - only call one time in entire application
